The template contains the basic features:
- MVC
- Logging (also on email)
- Debugging
- Tests (Unit, functional, acceptance)


REQUIREMENTS
------------

- PHP 5.4+
``` 
add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php && apt update
apt install php7.3 php7.3-cli php7.3-fpm php7.3-curl php7.3-json php7.3-gd php7.3-mbstring php7.3-zip php7.3-xml
```
 - Composer
If you do not have [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/), you may install it by following the instructionsat [getcomposer.org](http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-nix).

INSTALLATION
------------

~~~
git clone https://github.com/pceuropa/imdb-search
cd imdb-search
composer update
~~~

### run standalone server
```
./yii serve
```

### Install with Docker

Update your vendor packages

    docker-compose run --rm php composer update --prefer-dist
    
Start the container

    docker-compose up -d
    
You can then access the application through the following URL:

    http://127.0.0.1:8000

**NOTES:** 
- Minimum required Docker engine version `17.04` for development (see [Performance tuning for volume mounts](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/osxfs-caching/))
- The default configuration uses a host-volume in your home directory `.docker-composer` for composer caches


DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
-------------------

      assets/             contains assets definition
      commands/           contains console commands (controllers)
      config/             contains application configurations
      controllers/        contains Web controller classes
      mail/               contains view files for e-mails
      models/             contains model classes
      runtime/            contains files generated during runtime
      tests/              contains various tests for the basic application
      vendor/             contains dependent 3rd-party packages
      views/              contains view files for the Web application
      web/                contains the entry script and Web resources

CONFIGURATION
-------------
Edit the file `config/web.php` with real data, for example:

TESTING
-------
Tests can be executed by running
```
vendor/bin/codecept run
```
Tests are located in `tests` directory. They are developed with [Codeception PHP Testing Framework](http://codeception.com/).
By default there are 3 test suites:

- `unit`
- `functional`
- `acceptance`


### Running  acceptance tests

To execute acceptance tests do the following:  

1. Rename `tests/acceptance.suite.yml.example` to `tests/acceptance.suite.yml` to enable suite configuration

2. Replace `codeception/base` package in `composer.json` with `codeception/codeception` to install full featured
   version of Codeception

3. Update dependencies with Composer 

    ```
    composer update  
    ```

4. Download [Selenium Server](http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/) and launch it:

    ```
    java -jar ~/selenium-server-standalone-x.xx.x.jar
    ```

    In case of using Selenium Server 3.0 with Firefox browser since v48 or Google Chrome since v53 you must download [GeckoDriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases) or [ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads) and launch Selenium with it:

    ```
    # for Firefox
    java -jar -Dwebdriver.gecko.driver=~/geckodriver ~/selenium-server-standalone-3.xx.x.jar
    
    # for Google Chrome
    java -jar -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=~/chromedriver ~/selenium-server-standalone-3.xx.x.jar
    ``` 
    
    As an alternative way you can use already configured Docker container with older versions of Selenium and Firefox:
    
    ```
    docker run --net=host selenium/standalone-firefox:2.53.0
    ```

5. (Optional) Create `yii2_basic_tests` database and update it by applying migrations if you have them.

   ```
   tests/bin/yii migrate
   ```

   The database configuration can be found at `config/test_db.php`.


6. Start web server:

    ```
    tests/bin/yii serve
    ```

7. Now you can run all available tests

   ```
   # run all available tests
   vendor/bin/codecept run

   # run acceptance tests
   vendor/bin/codecept run acceptance

   # run only unit and functional tests
   vendor/bin/codecept run unit,functional
   ```

### Code coverage support

By default, code coverage is disabled in `codeception.yml` configuration file, you should uncomment needed rows to be able
to collect code coverage. You can run your tests and collect coverage with the following command:

```
#collect coverage for all tests
vendor/bin/codecept run -- --coverage-html --coverage-xml

#collect coverage only for unit tests
vendor/bin/codecept run unit -- --coverage-html --coverage-xml

#collect coverage for unit and functional tests
vendor/bin/codecept run functional,unit -- --coverage-html --coverage-xml
```

You can see code coverage output under the `tests/_output` directory.
